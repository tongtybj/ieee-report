In this paper, we show the achievement of multiple objects transportation by a transformable aerial robot. As it is not easy to make the endurance of an aerial robot longer, we focus on a way that aerial robot transports multiple objects at the same time to improve the efficiency of transportation. However, for conventional aerial robots, multiple objects transportation is difficult because the CoG position changes when the number of objects the aerial robot grasp changes, resulting in the instability of the flight. Therefore, to solve this problem, we focus on multirotor with two-dimensional multilinks which has the ability to modify the position of CoG actively and can keep the flight stable. We propose a method to find the optimal form for the multilinks based on the flight stability. Then, we explain the hardware and software system including the structure of a link module, an electromagnet gripper and internal communication. Finally, we present the experimental result of multiple objects transportation which includes approaching, grasping and transforming.
