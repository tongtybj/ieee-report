In this paper, we show the achievement of a transformable aerial robot with internal communication system for multiple objects transportation. As it is not easy to make the endurance of an aerial robot longer, we focus on a way that aerial robot transports multiple objects at the same time to improve the efficiency of transportation. However, for conventional aerial robots, multiple objects transportation is difficult because the CoG position changes when the number of objects the aerial robot grasps changes, resulting in the instability of the flight. Therefore, to solve this problem, we focus on multirotor with two-dimensional multilinks in our previous work which possesses the ability to modify the CoG position actively and can keep the flight stable. Moreover, we investigate a novel hardware structure of multilinks to extend the number of links. We explain the hardware platform including the structure of link module and internal communication system. We then propose a method to find the optimal form for the multilinks based on the flight stability. Finally, we present the experimental result which includes aerial transformation and multiple objects transportation.
